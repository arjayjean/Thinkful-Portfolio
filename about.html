            <h1><u>About Arjay Jean</u></h1>
            <p>I was born and raised out of North Miami Beach, Florida. Growing up, I have always been into martial
                arts,
                ninjas, science fiction, and sports. All these things led me to fitness because I wanted to be as fast,
                strong, athletic, and
                physically imposing as the fictional characters and athletes, I admired.</p>

            <p>As I was trying to be like Batman, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, or the athletes I looked up to, I
                had no
                direction for my life. I had no idea what I was going to do for a career or how I was getting to
                college.
                That is when my mom
                challenged me with an ultimatum. <span><u>"Either join the military or receive a
                        scholarship."</u></span> At
                the time, I thought the military meant getting shot at for a living, so I picked the scholarship.</p>

            <p>After a few years of working hard during my time in high school, I achieved that goal. I was able to
                receive
                a full-ride scholarship to Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. After those four years,
                I
                closed a chapter in my
                life. Now, I am on to bigger, better things as I transition my work ethic into a software development or
                cybersecurity career.</p>
