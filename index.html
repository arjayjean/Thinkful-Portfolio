            <h2 class="home-titles"><u>Background</u></h2>
            <p>For the past four years, I have dedicated two and a half years to my sport, which allowed me to receive a
                free education. After an unexpected retirement, I committed my final years to find my next challenge and
                purpose in life. For the next
                few years, I entered many roles that sparked my interest until I discovered software development and
                cybersecurity.</p>
            <p>Software development and cybersecurity gives me the challenge that I was looking for after my collegiate
                career. With my adaptive and challenger mindset, I can learn and challenge myself with different
                programs, which will give me the capability to be adaptive in the
                workspace. This career is forever changing, and I love how there is always something new to learn.</p>
            <p>The skills I learn along the way, I want to be able to share with other developers or first-timers. With
                past experiences, my top strengths (input, developing, and connecting) appeared as I have been in many
                roles that matched them. As I
                enter this profession, that will not change.</p>

        <!-- Goals -->
        <section class="card">
            <h2 class="home-titles"><u>Goals</u></h2>
            <p>I want to master the process of building and protecting websites and increase my knowledge, skills and
                abilities in standard web development and cybersecurity languages.</p>
            <ul class="skills">
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>jQuery</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>C</li>

                <li>And more . . .</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I would like to work for a company that help clients create an impressive online presence and/or protect
                their servers and credentials. </p>
            <p>My ultimate goal is to help both my clients and other developers reach their goals. Service has been a
                foundation for both my family and everything that I have been apart of. It is only right to do the same
                for a career.</p>
